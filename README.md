# Mini shell With pipe - operating systems 
======================================================================================

mini shell operating systems with pipe (Single or double pipe support (but no more)).

Our program performs operating system operations, executes up to three commands together using a "pipe", that is, 
we produce two sub processes and one "pipe" so that they can communicate with each other and each process will execute a command 
and so at the end we will merge the commands so that there is command over command.
